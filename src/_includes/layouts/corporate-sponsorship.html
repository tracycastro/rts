          All proceeds from MacTheatre concessions go to the RTS scholarship
          fund, which is used to provide scholarships for student production
          fees, enrichment programs, and college. By offsetting our concessions
          costs, our concessions sponsor helps to ensure that all McCallum
          students, regardless of their financial circumstances, are able to
          participate in high quality theatre productions and enrichment
          programs. Contact us to learn more about how you can provide equal
