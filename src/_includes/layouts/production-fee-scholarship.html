        Production Fees (also known as Fair Share Fees) are annual fees that are
        required of all performance theatre majors, technical theatre majors,
        musical certificate students, and any other student participating in a
        production.

        No student will be prevented from participating in theatre because of an
        inability to pay. MacTheatre and the Royale Theatre Society believe that
        all students, regardless of their financial circumstances, should have
        access to high quality theatre productions and programs.
