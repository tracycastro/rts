          In-kind contributions are integral to RTSâ€™s mission of supporting
          MacTheatre productions. Contributions such as meals to feed the cast
          and crew or printing services to cover playbill costs enable us to
          devote more of our limited budget to production costs and new
          enrichment opportunities for our students.
